# Cipher Dataset creater and AI classifier 

This is a repositiory that contains a bunch of classical ciphers and methods of encyption dataset creators, It also includes a juptier notebook and will also include some of the text classifcation code. There is not much learning in this rathers this will just be for ease of creating said datasets. For more information and to find where i originally found the encoding programs please refer to: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ they have a bunch of great tools.
